# minimalReprex

The goal of `minimalReprex` is to demonstrate problems with rendering `LaTeX`
equations on `README` of `pkgdown` websites.

## Example

This is inline with the text $\eta^2$, but this text moves to the next line.

This doesn't get rendered properly either (it's always the extra space):

option-1 | option-2
-------|-------
$\eta^2$ | $\eta^2_p$
x | y
